# Employee Retention Classification Model
___
### Project Background
Hiring and retaining top talent is an extremely challenge task for the Human Resources department, which requires capital, time, and skills. Business owners spend up to 40% of their time on simple tasks not resulting in direct profit, such as hiring. For a new hire 15-20% of their salary is spent on just recruitment. This Human Resource case study is created to leverage the power of data science to reduce employee turnover and optimize the Human Resource department. Using extensive data of the employees, the developed model predicts which employees are more likely to quit.

By utilizing this classification model, the company will be able to focus more on retention, including encouraging career growth, higher salary, more benefits, and extra vacation for those employees identified as more likely to stay.

This repository holds the work completed for my Employee Retention Classification Model. Currently it's into 4 different categories:
  1. Problem Overview
  2. Data Exploration & Visualization
  3. Data Modeling
  4. Conclusion
